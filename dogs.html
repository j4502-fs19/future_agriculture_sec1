	<h2>PHARM Dog USA gives a helping paw to farmers who need it</h2>

  <p>Lisa Hamilton gave the brisk command and earned exactly the reaction she wanted.</p>

  <p>“Let’s go to work!” she ordered, and the black-and-tan mixed breed stopped playing with a toy and raced to Hamilton's side.</p>

  <p>Hamilton grabbed a bucket and a pair of gloves and began to cross the room with Zoey at her side.</p>

  <p>Along the way, she dropped the gloves but just kept on walking.</p>

  <p>Zoey pivoted to a stop, gently picked up the gloves in her mouth and returned them to Hamilton.</p>

  <p>This was a practice run for Zoey, a Puppies for Parole graduate who could eventually become a well-trained companion.</p>

  <p>She is a part of PHARM Dog USA, a nonprofit organization based in Albany, Missouri, that teaches dogs to help farmers with physical, cognitive or illness-related disabilities.</p>

  <p>The dogs can help with farm tasks that range from managing livestock to recovering dropped tools, opening gates, carrying buckets and running for help when needed.</p>

Danny Miller said his apples will double in size by the end of the growing season. He is in a race with nature to prevent Japanese beetles from destroying his apples before they reach full maturity.</p>
