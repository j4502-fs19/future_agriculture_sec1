	<h2>MU student develops high-tech collar to track changes in pregnant cows</h2>

	<p>COLUMBIA — Up to 10% of the 31.7 million beef cows in the United States will die from calving difficulty. This creates a financial burden on producers throughout the cattle industry, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>


<p>Libby Martin, a second-year MU veterinary science student, founded Calving Technologies to combat this loss with innovative collar technology.</p>

<p>	During calving season, physiological changes can overcome the pregnant cows prior to giving birth. When these changes occur, the narrow margin between life and death is often a matter of time.</p> <p>Producers try to check on their cows before birth, but they often can’t locate them or asses their health issues in time for a successful delivery. </p>


<p> Martin has devised collars that can be worn by any pregnant cow. When a birth date approaches, the collar alerts producers on their smartphones or laptops if there is a drastic physiological change. The collar instantly reports physical data like body temperature and heart rate for each cow at that specific time.  </p>

<p>“We’re tracking the early onset physiological changes that someone couldn’t see," Martin said. "Our product tracks those parameters over a period of time leading up to calving so the producers have an inclusive history of what’s going on with every animal.” </p>


<p> These updates give producers enough time to locate and asses the cattle before it’s too late. </p>

<p>“We’re trying to provide preventative measures for producers to actually intervene,” Martin said. </p>

<p>She began noticing this issue on her family's farm in California, Missouri, when she was in high school. </p>

<p>“Growing up, I was used to seeing a lot of our cows struggle during calving season," Martin said. "When I say calving difficulties that just means maybe the calf was malpositioned inside, or the cow was under some sort of distress.”</p>
