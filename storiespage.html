	<p>COLUMBIA — The Convention and Visitors Advisory Board denied a funding request from the Clary-Shy Agriculture Park on Monday.

The park’s request for $250,000 from the board was denied due to concerns about its ability to attract tourism in a 4-3 vote. Two other programs, the Norm Stewart Classic and the “We Always Swing” Jazz Series, received part of their requested funding.</p>


<p>The agriculture park is an expansion project in Clary-Shy Park on West Ash Street that will attempt to improve the current farmers market that sets up every Saturday there. It will include an outdoor classroom, farmers market pavilion, play structures and a market music performance area, according to a plan of the park’s layout.

Stephanie Bell, one of the board members, said she would enjoy the park, but the investment wasn’t in line with the advisory board’s goals.</p>


<p>“I loved the farmers market,” Bell said. “It was my favorite thing to do in Overland Park, but I would never drive to Overland Park now and do it. I just don’t see anyone coming in who isn’t already here.”

Kimberly Trabue, a board member who voted in favor of the funding, said she was not against the park returning with more information on prospective tourism. She said she would like to see more information on possible events the park could hold.

The funds the park’s advocates were asking for would have helped to fund the building where the farmer’s market would be.</p>


<p>In addition to the park, representatives from the Norm Stewart Classic and the Jazz Series came to present their projects before the board. The Classic was given $10,000 of its original $15,000 request, and the Jazz Series received $7,500 of its original $10,000 request.

The Norm Stewart Classic is an annual basketball event in December at Columbia College held by the Missouri Basketball Coaches Association. The Jazz Series is an all-jazz concert series, producing and educational organization whose primary support comes from ticket revenue and grants, according to its website.

The board members said in the discussion that they decided to support both these organizations because of the tourist revenue and hotel rooms their events could generate.</p>

<p>The board is not the only source of funds for the park. The project has succeeded in raising money from a range of other sources. In May, around $1.7 million had been raised for the project, with MU Health Care donating the most at $495,000. The parks sales tax, a sales tax for local parks applied to all retail sales made in Columbia, has donated the second most at $400,000, said Billy Polansky, executive director of the Columbia Center for Urban Agriculture.

“We are going to be creating a local foods destination in the heart of Columbia,” Polansky said. “(A farmers market) is something people are looking for when they travel.”

As of Monday, the campaign had raised a little over $2.5 million, with $525,000 made in the last week, he said.
